| # Doel van de EBM Gids|Purpose of the EBM Guide|H1|
| Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is een empirische aanpak die organisaties helpt met continue verbeteren van: klant-uitkomsten, organisatie-bekwaamheid en bedrijfsresultaten in onzekere situaties. Het levert een raamwerk voor organisaties om hun bekwaamheid te verbeteren waarmee ze waarde leveren in een onzekere wereld, en een weg zoeken naar strategische doelen. Door gebruik te maken van doelgerichte experimenten en bewijs (metingen), stelt EBM organisaties in staat om hun prestaties systematisch te verbeteren met de tijd en hun doelen aan te scherpen met betere informatie. | Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is an empirical approach that helps organizations to continuously improve customer outcomes, organizational capabilities, and business results under conditions of uncertainty. It provides a framework for organizations to improve their ability to deliver value in an uncertain world, seeking a path toward strategic goals. Using intentional experimentation and evidence (measures), EBM enables organizations to systematically improve their performance over time and refine their goals based on better information. | |
| Door huidige omstandigheden te meten, prestatiedoelen te stellen, kleine experimenten voor verbetering op te zetten (die snel kunnen worden uitgevoerd), het effect van het experiment te meten, en doelen en vervolgstappen te inspecteren en adapteren, helpt EBM organisaties rekening te houden met het beste beschikbare bewijs om besluiten te nemen over manieren om te verbeteren. | By measuring current conditions, setting performance goals, forming small experiments for improvement that can be run quickly, measuring the effect of the experiment, and inspecting and adapting goals and next steps, EBM helps organizations to take into account the best available evidence to help them make decisions on ways to improve. | |

| # EBM Helpt Organisaties in een Complexe Wereld om Empirisme te Gebruiken in de Zoektocht naar hun Doelen | EBM Helps Organizations Seek toward Their Goals in a Complex World Using Empiricism ||
| Complexe problemen hebben geen eenvoudige oplossingen, maar dwingen organisaties te zoeken naar hun doelen in opeenvolgende kleine stappen, waarbij de resultaten van elke stap geïnspecteerd worden, en de vervolgacties op basis van feedback worden aangepast (adaptatie) (zie Figuur 1).<sup>1</sup> | Complex problems defy easy solutions, but instead require organizations seek toward their goals in a series of small steps, inspecting the results of each step, and adapting their next actions based on feedback (see Figure 1).<sup>1</sup> ||
| Dit model bestaat uit een aantal essentiële elementen: | This model has several key elements: ||
| - Een *Strategisch Doel*, dit is iets belangrijks dat de organisatie graag wil behalen. Dit doel is zo groot en ver weg, met vele onzekerheden op de weg er naar toe, dat de organisatie niet anders kan dan empirisme gebruiken. Omdat het Strategisch Doel ambitieus is en de weg er naar toe onzeker, heeft de organisatie een serie praktische doelen nodig, zoals | - A *Strategic Goal*, which is something important that the organization would like to achieve. This goal is so big and far away, with many uncertainties along the journey that the organization must use empiricism. Because the Strategic Goal is aspirational and the path to it is uncertain, the organization needs a series of practical targets, like ||
| - *Tussenliggende Doelen*, waarvan het behalen aangeeft dat de organisatie op weg is naar het *Strategisch Doel*. De weg naar het *Tussendliggende Doel* is vaak nog steeds enigszins onzeker, maar niet volledig onbekend. | - *Intermediate Goals*, achievements of which will indicate that the organization is on the path to its *Strategic Goal*. The path to the *Intermediate Goal* is often still somewhat uncertain, but not completely unknown. ||
| - *Directe Tactische Doelen*, essentiële korte-termijn-doelen waar een team of groep van teams naartoe werkt, die bijdragen aan  *Tussenliggende Doelen*. | - *Immediate Tactical Goals*, critical near-term objectives toward which a team or group of teams will work help toward Intermediate Goals. ||
| - Een *Begintoestand*, dit is waar de organisatie zich bevindt, relatief aan het *Strategische Doel*, aan het begin van haar reis. | - A *Starting State*, which is where the organization is relative to the Strategic Goal when it starts its journey. ||
| - Een *Huidige Toestand*, dit is waar de organisatie zich bevindt, relatief aan het *Strategische Doel*, op dit moment. | - A *Current State*, which is where the organization is relative to the Strategic Goal at the present time. ||
| Om voortgang te maken naar het *Strategische Doel* voeren organisaties experimenten uit waarin hypotheses gevormd worden, die bedoeld zijn om de organisatie richting hun huidige *Tussenliggende Doel* te bewegen. Terwijl zij deze experimenten uitvoeren en resultaten verzamelen, gebruiken ze het verkregen bewijs om hun doelen te evalueren en vervolgstappen te bepalen waarmee voortgang gemaakt kan worden naar deze doelen. | In order to progress toward the Strategic Goal, organizations run experiments which involve forming hypotheses that are intended to advance the organization toward their current Intermediate Goal. As they run these experiments and gather results, they use the evidence they obtain to evaluate their goals and determine their next steps to advance toward these goals. ||

## Setting Goals
| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ## Setting Goals | H2 |
|| When setting goals, organizations must define specific measures that will indicate that the goal is achieved. Goals, measures, and experiments should be made transparent in order to encourage organizational alignment. ||
|| > *Consider the case of the response to an infectious disease:* ||
|| >- *The Strategic Goal is to eradicate the effects of the disease, as measured by the number of people who fall ill and suffer significant illness. Measurement is important; in this example, the goal is focused on the effects of the disease, and not on the means for achieving the desired impact. For example, the goal is not to vaccinate a certain percentage of the population against the disease; that may be an activity necessary to achieving the Strategic Goal, but it is not the Strategic Goal.* ||
|| >- *An example of an Intermediate Goal is the successful completion of a trial of a vaccine against the disease. This is still ambitious and measurable, and achieving it may require the completion of many different activities, but it is seen as a necessary step on the path to achieving the Strategic Goal.* ||
|| >- *Examples of immediate tactical goals may include activities like isolating symptoms, evaluating a therapy, sequencing the DNA of a virus or bacterium, and so forth.* ||
|| *The Strategic Goal* is usually focused on achieving a highly desirable but unrealized outcome for a specific group of people that results in improved happiness, safety, security, or well-being of the recipients of some product or service. In EBM, we refer to this as *Unrealized Value*, which is the satisfaction gap between a beneficiary’s desired outcome and their current experience. *Unrealized Value* is described in greater detail below, in the *Key Value Areas* section. ||

# Understanding What Is Valuable
| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| # Understanding What Is Valuable | H1 |
|| Organizations measure many different kinds of things. Broadly speaking, measures fall into three categories: ||
|| - **Activities.** These are things that people in the organization do, such as perform work, go to meetings, have discussions, write code, create reports, attend conferences, and so forth. ||
|| - **Outputs.** These are things that the organization produces, such as product releases (including features), reports, defect reports, product reviews, and so on. ||
|| - **Outcomes.** These are desirable things that a customer or user of a product experiences. They represent some new or improved capability that the customer or user was not able to achieve before. Examples include being able to travel to a destination faster than before, or being able to earn or save more money than before. Outcomes can also be negative, as in the case where the value a customer or user experiences declines from previous experiences, for example when a service they previously relied upon is no longer available. ||
|| The problem most organizations face, which is often reflected in the things they measure, is that measuring activities and outputs is easy, while measuring outcomes is difficult. Organizations may gather a lot of data with insufficient information about their ability to deliver value. However, delivering valuable outcomes to customers is essential if organizations are to reach their goals. For example, working more hours (activities) and delivering more features (outputs) does not necessarily lead to improved customer experiences (outcomes). ||

## EBM Focuses on Four Key Value Areas
| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ## EBM Focuses on Four Key Value Areas | H2 |
|| In addition to using hypotheses and experiments to move toward goals, EBM provides a set of perspectives on value and the organization’s ability to deliver value. These perspectives are called *Key Value Areas (KVAs)*. These areas examine the goals of the organization (Unrealized Value), the current state of the organization relative to those goals (Current Value), the responsiveness of the organization in delivering value (Time-to-Market), and the effectiveness of the organization in delivering value (Ability-to-Innovate). Focusing on these four dimensions enables organizations to better understand where they are and where they need to go (see Figure 2). | |
|| ![Figure 2: EBM focuses on four Key Value Areas (KVAs).](https://github.com/ScrumFacilitators/EBM-Gids-NL/blob/main/resources/Figure%202%20-%20EBM%20focuses%20on%20four%20Key%20Value%20Areas.png?raw=true) ||
|| **Figure 2: EBM focuses on four Key Value Areas (KVAs).** ||
|| Each KVA focuses on a different aspect of either value, or the ability of the organization to deliver value. Delivering business value (*Current Value*) is important, but organizations must also show that they can respond to change (*Time-to-Market*) while being able to sustain innovation over time (*Ability-to-Innovate*). And they must be able to continually make progress toward their long-term goals (*Unrealized Value*) or they risk succumbing to stagnation and complacency. ||
|| Example Key Value Measures (KVMs) for each KVA are described in the Appendix. ||

### Current Value (CV)
#### The value that the product delivers today

| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ### Current Value (CV) | H3 |
|| #### The value that the product delivers today | H4 of BOLD ** |
|| The purpose of looking at CV is to understand the value that an organization delivers to customers and stakeholders at the present time; it considers only what exists right now, not the value that might exist in the future. Questions that organizations need to continually re-evaluate for current value are: ||
|| 1. How happy are users and customers today? Is their happiness improving or declining? ||
|| 2. How happy are your employees today? Is their happiness improving or declining? ||
|| 3. How happy are your investors and other stakeholders today? Is their happiness improving or declining? ||
|| Considering CV helps an organization understand the value that their customers or users experience *today*. ||
|| > **Example:** *While profit, one way to measure investor happiness, will tell you the economic impact of the value that you deliver, knowing whether customers are happy with their purchase will tell you more about where you may need to improve to keep those customers. If your customers have few alternatives to your product, you may have high profit even though customer satisfaction is low. Considering CV from several perspectives will give you a better understanding of your challenges and opportunities.* ||
|| > *Customer happiness and investor happiness also do not tell the whole story about your ability to deliver value. Considering employee attitudes recognizes that employees are ultimately the producers of value. Engaged employees that know how to maintain, sustain and enhance the product are one of the most significant assets of an organization, and happy employees are more engaged and productive.* ||

### Unrealized Value (UV)
#### The potential future value that could be realized if the organization met the needs of all potential customers or users

| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ### Unrealized Value (UV) | H3 |
|| #### The potential future value that could be realized if the organization met the needs of all potential customers or users | H4 of BOLD ** |
|| Looking at Unrealized Value helps an organization to maximize the value that it realizes from a product or service over time. When customers, users, or clients experience a gap between their current experience and the experience that they would like to have, the difference between the two represents an opportunity; this opportunity is measured by *Unrealized Value*. ||
|| Questions that organizations need to continually re-evaluate for UV are: ||
|| 1. Can any additional value be created by our organization in this market or other markets? ||
|| 2. Is it worth the effort and risk to pursue these untapped opportunities? ||
|| 3. Should further investments be made to capture additional Unrealized Value? ||
|| The consideration of both CV and UV provides organizations with a way to balance present and possible future benefits. Strategic Goals are formed from some satisfaction gap and an opportunity for an organization to decrease UV by increasing CV. ||
|| >**Example:** *A product may have low CV, because it is an early version being used to test the market, but very high UV, indicating that there is great market potential. Investing in the product to try to boost CV is probably warranted, given the potential returns, even though the product is not currently producing high CV.* ||
|| >*Conversely, a product with very high CV, large market share, no near competitors, and very satisfied customers may not warrant much new investment; this is the classic cash cow product that is very profitable but nearing the end of its product investment cycle with low UV.* ||

### Time-to-Market (T2M)
#### The organization’s ability to quickly deliver new capabilities, services, or products

| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ### Time-to-Market (T2M) | H3 |
|| #### The organization’s ability to quickly deliver new capabilities, services, or products | 4 of BOLD ** |
|| The *reason for looking* at T2M is to minimize the amount of time it takes for the organization to deliver value. Without actively managing T2M, the ability to sustainably deliver value in the future is unknown. Questions that organizations need to continually re-evaluate for T2M are: ||
|| 1. How fast can the organization learn from new experiments and information? ||
|| 2. How fast can you adapt based on the information? ||
|| 3. How fast can you test new ideas with customers? ||
|| Improving T2M helps improve the frequency at which an organization can potentially change CV. ||
|| >**Example:** *Reducing the number of features in a product release can dramatically improve T2M; the smallest release possible is one that delivers at least some incremental improvement in value to some subset of the customers/users of the product. Many organizations also focus on removing non value-added activities from the product development and delivery process to improve their T2M.* ||

### Ability to Innovate (A2I)
#### The effectiveness of an organization to deliver new capabilities that might better meet customer needs

| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ### Ability to Innovate (A2I) | H3 |
|| #### The effectiveness of an organization to deliver new capabilities that might better meet customer needs | 4 of BOLD ** |
|| The *goal* of looking at the A2I is to maximize the organization’s ability to deliver new capabilities and innovative solutions. Organizations should continually re-evaluate their A2I by asking: ||
|| 1. What prevents the organization from delivering new value? ||
|| 2. What prevents customers or users from benefiting from that innovation? ||
|| Improving A2I helps an organization become more effective in ensuring that the work that it does improves the value that its products or services deliver to customers or users. ||
|| >**Example:** *A variety of things can impede an organization from being able to deliver new capabilities and value: spending too much time remedying poor product quality, needing to maintain multiple variations of a product due to lack of operational excellence, lack of decentralized decision-making, inability to hire and inspire talented, passionate team- members, and so on.* ||
|| > *As low-value features and systemic impediments accumulate, more budget and time is consumed maintaining the product or overcoming impediments, reducing its available capacity to innovate. In addition, anything that prevents users or customers from benefiting from innovation, such as hard to assemble/install products or new versions of products, will also reduce A2I.* ||

## Progress toward Goals in A Series of Small Steps

| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ## Progress toward Goals in A Series of Small Steps | H2 |
|| The first step in the journey toward a Strategic Goal is understanding your Current State. If your focus is to achieve a Strategic Goal related to Unrealized Value (UV), as is typically the case, then measuring the Current Value (CV) your product or service delivers is where you should start (of course, if your product or service is new then its CV will be zero). To understand where you need to improve, you may also need to understand your effectiveness (A2I), and your responsiveness (T2M). ||
|| The Experiment Loop (shown in Figure 1) helps organizations move from their Current State toward their Next Target Goal, and ultimately their Strategic Goal, by taking small, measured steps, called experiments, using explicit hypotheses.[3] This loop consists of: ||
|| - **Forming a hypothesis for improvement.** Based on experience, form an idea of something you think will help you move toward your Next Target Goal, and decide how you will know whether this experiment succeeded based on measurement. ||
|| - **Running your experiments.** Make the change you think will help you to improve and gather data to support or refute your hypothesis. ||
|| - **Inspecting your results.** Did the change you made improve your results based on the measurements you have made? Not all changes do; some changes actually make things worse. ||
|| - **Adapting your goals or your approach based on what you learned.** Both your goals and your improvement experiments will likely evolve as you learn more about customers, competitors, and your organization's capabilities. Goals can change because of outside events, and your tactics to reach your goals may need to be reconsidered and revised. Was the *Intermediate Goal* the right goal? Is the *Strategic Goal* still relevant? If you achieved the *Intermediate Goal*, you will need to choose a new *Intermediate Goal*. If you did not achieve it, you will need to decide whether you need to persevere, stop, or pivot toward something new. If your *Strategic Goal* is no longer relevant, you will need to either adapt it, or replace it. ||
|| 3. The Experiment Loop is a variation on the Shewhart Cycle, popularized by W. Edwards Deming, also sometimes called the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA. ||

## Hypotheses, Experiments, Features, and Requirements

| Nederlands | English | opmerkingen |
| --- | --- | --- |
|| ## Hypotheses, Experiments, Features, and Requirements | H2 |
|| *Features* are “distinguishing characteristics of a product”[4], while a *requirement* is, practically speaking, something that someone thinks would be desirable in a product. A *feature description* is one kind of requirement. ||
|| Organizations can spend a lot of money implementing features and other requirements in products, only to find that customers don’t share the company’s opinion on their value; beliefs in what is valuable are merely assumptions until they are validated by customers. This is where hypotheses and experiments are useful. ||
|| In simplified terms, a *hypothesis* is a proposed explanation for some observation that has not yet been proven (or disproven). In the context of requirements, it is a belief that *doing something will lead to something else*, such as *delivering feature X will lead to outcome Y*. An experiment is a test that is designed to prove or reject some hypothesis. ||
|| Every feature and every requirement really represent a hypothesis about value. One of the goals of an empirical approach is to make these hypotheses explicit and to consciously design experiments that explicitly test the value of the features and requirements. The entire feature or requirement need not actually be built to determine whether it is valuable; it may be sufficient for a team to simply build enough of it to validate critical assumptions that would prove or disprove its value. ||
|| Explicitly forming hypotheses, measuring results, and inspecting and adapting goals based on those results are implicit parts of an agile approach. Making this work explicit and transparent is what EBM adds to the organizational improvement process. ||
